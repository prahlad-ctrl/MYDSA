# My Java DSA Library ðŸš€

This is a personal project to build a custom Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) library in Java from scratch. The goal is to deeply understand the underlying principles of common data structures and algorithms by implementing them without relying on built-in Java Collection Framework classes.

---

### Project Introduction

The library is a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each component is implemented with a focus on clarity and efficiency, serving as a hands-on learning tool and a reusable set of code for future projects.

### Features added till now (currently updating)

-   **Data Structures:**
    -   `DynamicArray`: A resizable array that automatically grows to accommodate new elements.
    -   `SinglyLinkedList`: A basic linked list where each node points to the next.
    -   `DoublyLinkedList`: A linked list where each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node.
    -   `Queue`: A linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
    -   `Stack`: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
    -   `Deque`: A more generalized version of a queue where elements can be added or removed from either the front or the back.
